I always enjoyed playing solitaire on Windows as a kid and would usually pick the robot card back. This is my attempt at somewhat recreating the game with themes made from CSS. I'm happy with how it works / looks right now ( other than one bug I'm aware of ) and I'm currently working on making the cards drag and drop. There was a lot of problem solving involved with both the javascript / CSS and I learned to think outside the box and make use of / being aware of all the tools available. Surprisingly one road block I ran into had an easy fix of using 'inherit' in a CSS property.

Writing good code from the start was another lesson learned. You never know if the code is going to work the first time you run it and I would often use bad naming conventions just to get the code on the page. Then, when I got everything working I'd go back to the top to read through what I just written and I'd have a hard time understanding it. So I've tried to write code better from the start so it saves time in the long run.
