I always enjoyed playing Solitaire on Windows as a kid. The robot card back was my usually pick, but I'd sometimes go with the bat castle when I was feeling edgy. This is my attempt at somewhat recreating the game with the skills that I have. To give myself a bit of a challenge the code is all in vanilla JS and CSS. So unfortanatly no robot. Maybe one day I'll try making a robot with just CSS.
