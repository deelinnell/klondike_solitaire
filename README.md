I enjoyed playing solitaire on Windows as a kid and would usually pick the robot card back, and sometimes the bat castle. I figured it would be good practice to recreate solitiare in javascript and would be fun to make some themes / card backs with CSS. Originally I was looking for a tutorial for solitaire in javascript for some help, but it turns out there isn't much. The best I could find was written in C# and that wouldn't be much help. So I ended up deciding to just build it solo.

This was definitely the hardest thing I had done to date, at least from a javascript perspective. It took a lot of debugging and thinking outside the box, but I eventually finished it, and I officially fixed the last bug I'm aware of a couple days ago. 

Writing good code from the start and being aware of all the tools at your disposal are a couple of the main things I learned making this. I had never used the 'inheret' property with CSS before and it ended up being the fix for a particular problem I was having, but it took me longer to come up with then I wish it would have. At least with something so basic. So know your tools.

When I first started writing code I thought 'shorter = better', but that's not really the case. After a few hours of working on an extra large function I finally got it working. I went back to the top to read through it and I had a much harder time reading it than I should have. You never know if a function is going to run the first time you try, and I was using short / bad names just to get the code on the page so I could get it working. Well, I learned that it's better to take your time coming up with good names because it's going to save you time in the long run.
