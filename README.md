I enjoyed playing solitaire on Windows as a kid. I'd usually play with the robot card back, but occasionally I'd pick the bat castle. I figured it would be good practice to recreate solitiare in javascript and make some themes / card backs with CSS. I was originally looking for a tutorial in javascript, but it turns out there isn't much. The best I could find was written in C# and that wouldn't be much help. So I decided I'd attempt to build the game solo.

This was definitely the hardest thing I had done to date, at least from a javascript perspective. It took a lot of debugging and thinking outside the box, but I eventually finished it, and I officially fixed the last bug I'm aware of a couple days ago. I'm currently working on making the cards drag and drop, which is another challenge, but I think I have it mostly figured out.

A couple things I learned building solitaire are to write good code from the start and also being aware of the tools at your disposal. I had never used the 'inheret' keyword in CSS before and it ended up being the fix for a particular problem I was having, but it took me longer to come up with than I wish it would have. At least for something as fundamental inheret.

When I first started writing code I thought 'shorter = better', but that's not really the case. After a few hours of working on an extra large function I finally got it working. I went back to the top to read through it and I had a much harder time reading it than I should have. You never know if a function is going to work the first time you try running it, and I was often using short / bad names just to get the code on the page so I could get it working. Well, I learned that it's better to take your time coming up with good names because it's going to save you time in the long run. Shorter isn't always better. Being able to read the code easily is much more important than how short it is.
