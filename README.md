I enjoyed playing solitaire on Windows as a kid and I figured it would be good practice to recreate it in javascript and make some themes / card backs with CSS. I was originally looking for a tutorial in javascript, but it turns out there isn't much. The best I could find was written in C# and that wouldn't be much help. So I decided I'd attempt to build the game solo. It took a lot of debugging and thinking outside the box, but I eventually finished it. I'm currently working on making the cards drag and drop.

A couple things I learned building solitaire are to write good code from the start. When I first started writing code I thought 'shorter = better', but that's not really the case. You never know if a function is going to work the first time you try running it, and I was often using short / bad names just to get the code on the page so I could get it working. Well, I learned that it's better to take your time coming up with good names because it's going to save you time in the long run. Shorter isn't always better. Being able to read the code easily is much more important than how short it is.
