I always enjoyed playing solitaire on Windows as a kid and would usually pick the robot card back. This is my attempt at somewhat recreating the game with themes made from CSS. I'm happy with how it works / looks right now ( other than one bug I'm aware of ) and I'm currently working on making the cards drag and drop. There was a lot of problem solving involved with both the javascript / CSS and I learned to think outside the box and make use of / being aware of all the tools available. Surprisingly one road block I ran into had an easy fix of using 'inherit' in a CSS property.
